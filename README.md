Library Management System (LMS) - Static HTML & CSS Prototype
=============================================================

This package is a pure frontend prototype using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).
It's intended for presentation, UI/UX demonstration, and documentation for your Software Engineering submission.

Files:
- index.html: Home / project overview
- catalog.html: Catalog layout (static examples)
- book.html: Book details (static example)
- login.html: Static login page mockup
- dashboard.html: Librarian dashboard mockup
- add_book.html: Add/Update Book form (static)
- issue_return.html: Issue/Return forms (static)
- reports.html: Reports mockup

Notes:
- Forms are non-functional (no JS/backend). They are for UI demonstration and printing/documentation.
- Replace placeholders with server integration or JS if you later need functionality.
